   <h1>Macaroni Soup</h1> 

   <img src="../images/creamy.jpg">

   <h3>Description</h3>
   
   <p> Macaroni Sopas is a rich chicken noodle soup dish that I really enjoy having during cold 
       weather, or even on an ordinary day — usually in the mid afternoon. I have had chicken macaroni 
       sopas ever since I was a kid. This soup has been my favorite; I remember having this every 
       afternoon as some sort of snack.</p>
    
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 lb chicken skin</li>
        <li> 2 ounces chopped ham</li>
        <li> 1/2 lb elbow macaroni</li>
        <li> 4 stalks celery minced </li>
        <li> 1 medium yellow onion minced</li>
        <li> 1 large carrot diced</li>
        <li> 1 1/2 cups chopped cabbage (optional)</li>
        <li> 4 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li> 6 to 8 cups water</li>
        <li> 1 1/2 cup fresh milk </li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li> salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken. Boil the chicken in low to medium heat for 45 minutes or until tender.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken and let cool. Set-aside the water used to boil the chicken. We'll use this later.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken reaches room temperature, shred the meat using your hands. Discard (throw away) the bones.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a clean large cooking pot.</li>
        <li>Pour-in the butter and oil. Once the butter and oil becomes hot, sauté the onion, carrot, and celery for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the shredded chicken and chopped ham. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour-in the chicken broth and the remaining water used to boil the chicken. Stir and let boil. Simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the elbow macaroni. Cook for 15 minutes. Add more water if needed.</li>
        <li>Pour-in the milk. Stir and let boil.</li>
        <li>Add salt and pepper to adjust the taste.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving bowl. Serve.</li>
        <li>Share and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
